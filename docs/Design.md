## Technology

We have selected the technologies for our project with a strong focus on simplicity and user-friendliness. Our goal is to create a seamless experience for our users, particularly in web applications, where ease of installation and use is paramount. Therefore, the technologies used were: 

- `Node.js` for client and server side applications;
- `SQLite3` for database management system;

This way, our project can be run with simple commands

```bash
$ node client.js <PORT>
$ node proxy.js <PORT_CLIENTS> <PORT_SERVERS>
$ node server.js <PORT>
```
